This plugin is designed for integration with the Bumbu: A [Symfony Analog of Lombok bundle](https://github.com/DenisKashchavtsev/bumbu-bandle). It enhances development by providing autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and support for working with attributes and methods generated by the bundle. A full description and documentation will be available with the alpha release.
